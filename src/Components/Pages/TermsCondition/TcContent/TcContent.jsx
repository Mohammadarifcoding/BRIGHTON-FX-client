                <p>
                    You may cancel a payment order at any time up until it is executed. Once executed, you cannot cancel or amend a payment order. You may exercise this right to cancel in the
                    following ways:
                </p>

                <p> A. by telephoning us on 01903 202702 OR 01273 030708</p>
                <p>B. by writing to us at 35 Chapel Road, Worthing, West Sussex, BN11 1EG OR 123 Queens Road, Brighton, BN1 3WB</p>

                <li>
                    Refunds of the Money Transfer amount, and subsequent cancellation of the underlying transaction, will be made upon the User's valid written request if payment of the Money Transfer
                    has not yet been made to the Beneficiary at the time the refund request is processed by Brighton FX. To stop a payment, Brighton FX first will have to check with its paying
                    correspondent to determine whether payment of the Money Transfer has been made to the Beneficiary. If Brighton FX can confirm that payment has not been made, the funds will be
                    returned and Brighton FX will refund such amount to the User, less any applicable fees and/or service charges. Except in the case of events beyond Brighton FX's control, it is
                    policy to refund the amount of the Money Transfer within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the written refund request. In cases where the Money Transfer funds were not
                    made available to the Beneficiary within the time frame specified by Brighton FX for the Service, subject to the regular business hours at the Money Transfer destination location,
                    Brighton FX shall refund the Money Transfer fee as well as the Money Transfer amount within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the User's written request to refund same.
                    Normally, these funds should be in Brighton FX's possession within fifteen (15) business days. Please note that refunds may take longer to process where internal Compliance checks
                    are required and/or Compliance related queries need to be addressed . Should a refund be delayed for any reason, Brighton FX will notify the respective User.
                </li>

                <li>Where you cancel a Payment Order or where we cannot complete a Payment Transaction for any reason, we will arrange for a full refund.</li>

                    {' '}
                    ii. you make a deposit in our account and fail to identify or proceed with a Payment Transaction within thirty (30) Business Days, we will refund the amount of the Payment
                    Transaction to you less the commission initially charged at our exchange rate applicable at the time of the refund. If we cannot refund the money to you because we are unable to
                    contact you and we do not have valid bank details for you that are sufficient for us to make the refund transfer, we will retain the funds subject to our safeguarding obligations.
