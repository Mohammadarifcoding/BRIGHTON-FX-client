                <p>
                    Personal Data is used for different purposes and is subject to different standards and regulations. In general, Personal Data is retained for as long as necessary to provide you
                    with the Services you request, to comply with applicable legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, and to ensure that you have a reasonable opportunity to access the Personal

                <p>
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized
                    use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable
                    legal requirements. For example:

                        have an on-going relationship with you. Once our relationship has ended (for example because the Services have been delivered and paid for in full, or you have exercised your
                        right to withdraw from the contract), we will, subject to any retention requirements under applicable laws, erase or anonymize your Personal Data.
